                        <li>I am trained in how to gain a comprehensive understanding of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Educated on how to explore current web3 developments, emerging trends, and regulatory issues regarding blockchain technology and the crypto market. My skills include how to apply frameworks and strategic applications of blockchain technology to identify innovation opportunities in businesses, governments, nonprofits, or new ventures. I was educated on developing a consulting business with Blockchain As A Service on how to build strategies that leverage blockchain and cryptocurrencies to address a challenge faced by your organization or industry.</li>

                    <i>University at Buffalo New York/Coursera</i> - <strong>Blockchain Basics/Blockchain Developer</strong>, 2019 Graduate
                    <ul>
                        <li>My Blockchain specialization provides a broad overview of the essential concepts of blockchain technology – by initially exploring the Bitcoin protocol followed by the Ethereum protocol – to lay the foundation necessary for developing applications and programming. I am equipped with the knowledge needed to create nodes on a personal Ethereum blockchain, create accounts, unlock accounts, mine, transact, transfer Ethers, and check balances. The education and skill I have about the decentralized peer-to-peer networks, an immutable distributed ledger and the trust model that defines a blockchain. This course enables trained me to explain basic components of a blockchain (transaction, block, block header, and the chain) its operations (verification, validation, and consensus model) underlying algorithms, and essentials of trust (hard fork and soft fork). Content includes the hashing and cryptography foundations indispensable to blockchain programming, which is the focus of two subsequent specialization courses, Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (Dapps). I was working on a virtual machine image, specifically created for this course, to build an Ethereum test chain and operate on the chain. This hands-on activities trained me to understand the workings of a blockchain, its transactions, blocks and mining.</li>
